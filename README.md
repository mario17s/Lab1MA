ZooApp - Zoo Animals Tracker

The application manages a list of animals in a zoo.
Each animal has a name, photo, age, description, caretaker name, date on which it has been brought to the zoo.
The main page of the application will have the list of animals (only name + photo).
When an item is clicked, a new page will be displayed. This will contain all the details of the animal.
The application should allow adding a new animal, deleting an animal and updating the information of an animal.
